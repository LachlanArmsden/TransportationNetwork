# Transportation Network Project
This is an academic project provided by QUT. 

## Summary of project
The goal was to create a simple Transportation Network program to calculate the shortest path between a set of intersections. 
QUT provided a template to complete this project by providing 4 files: 
- Menu.cs - Which controlled the navigation of the program
- Program.cs - Which executes the project.
- Tests folder - Which contains a set of text and image files for use in the program
- TransporationNetwork.cs - Which is where I coded the functionality of the program, as indicated by the "to be completed by students" comments in this file.

## How to use
Firstly the user must load a network into the program.
To do this, pick "1" as the option in the menu then type the file name that needs to be loaded in. 
An example of this is "Text_4.txt" which loads the Test 4 file. Any Test.txt files can be loaded in within the Tests folder for the program.
